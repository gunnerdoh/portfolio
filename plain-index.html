    <section id="about">
        <h3>I'm Gunner, a Junior studying <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics">Informatics</a> at the University of Washington.</h3>
        <p>I most recently worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Axiom Health, working on projects from data analysis and visualization, building automated information capture tools, prompt engineering, and financial analysis. I've also sold shoes, bussed tables, taught computer science, and worked as a surf instructor.</p>
        <p>The coolest thing I've done since starting college was spending a month in Ethiopia with UW's Information School. There, I learned about higher education in Addis Ababa and designed solutions to help increase access to certifiable skills for residents who cannot attend traditional university. I also met a lot of cool people and had a lot of great food.</p>
        <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy surfing, camping, playing music, and rock climbing.</p>
